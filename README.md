# Minion The Bun Website
This project is a self-learning React JS for five days. The website uses Edamam Nutrition Analysis API and React JS to create a nutrition web app. Users need to enter the name and the amount of food they want to look for nutrition facts, and the app will call API to retrieve data and display it on the website. The website is deployed on Firebase Hosting, and here is the link for the demo: https://minionthebun.web.app/.

## Future Works
Search for nutrient facts and check if that food is safe for bunny eat.
